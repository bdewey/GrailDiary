# _Factfulness_, Hans Rosling

For fun I'm including some **bold** text at the front, just to make sure it works.

- The _gap instinct_ is the tendency to divide the world into two distinct groups with nothing but empty space in between. (E.g., the "developed" and "developing" worlds.)
- The _negativity instinct_ means that information about bad events is much more likely to reach us. When things are getting better we often don't hear about them.
- To control the negativity instinct, remember that things can be both _bad and getting better_.
- _Beware of rosy pasts_: People often glorify their early experiences, and nations often glorify their histories.
- The _straight line instinct_ is the tendency to assume that whatever is happening now will continue happening indefinitely into the future.
- Change in things that have diminishing returns may show an _s bend curve_: Rapid growth then leveling off.
- An interesting not-straight-line change is a _hump_: Things get worse before they get better. (Dental health, motor vehicle accidents.)
- Not-straight-line: "Nobody understands _exponential growth_." -- Mark Zuckerberg
- To control the straight line instinct, remember that _curves come in different shapes_.
- To control the fear instinct, _calculate the risks_.
- _Get calm before you carry on_: Make as few decisions as possible when panicked.
- The exploited part of _the fear instinct_ is it gets through your attention filter.
- "That is all there is to the _80/20 rule_. We tend to assume that all items on a list are equally important, but usually just a few of them are more important than all of the others put together."
- The PIN code of the world: _1114_ (the number, in rounded billions, of people in the Americas / Europe / Africa / Asia). By the end of the century it will be _1145_.
- The _size instinct_: Beware of lonely numbers. When a lonely number seems impressive (large or small), remember you could get the opposite impression if it were compared or divided by some other relevant number.
- Three techniques to help with the size instinct: 1) _Compare_; 2) _80/20_; 3) _Divide_.
- The generalization instinct: _Categories can be misleading_.
- Controlling the generalization instinct: Look for _differences within groups_ and _similarities across groups_.
- Controlling the generalization instinct: Beware of _the majority_.
- Beware of exceptional examples.
- Half-built homes in Tunisia: _Assume you are not normal and other people are not idiots_.
- The _destiny instinct_ is the idea that innate characteristics determine the outcome of people, countries, religions, or cultures.
- Controlling the destiny instinct: 1) _Slow change is not no change_. 2) _Be prepared to update your knowledge_. 3) _Talk to grandpa_.
- "I call this preference for single causes and single solutions _the single perspective instinct_."
- One problem that comes from the single perspective instinct: Remembering that experts are only experts in their own field.
- "History is full of visionaries who used simple utopian visions to justify terrible actions. Welcome complexity. Combine ideas. Compromise. Solve problems on a case-by-case basis."
- The _blame instinct_ is the instinct to find a clear, simple reason for why something bad has happened.
- Controlling the blame instinct: 1) Look for _causes, not villains_; 2) Look for _systems, not heroes_.
- To control the urgency instinct, take small steps: 1) Take _a breath_; 2) Insist on _the data_; 3) Beware of _fortune tellers_; 4) Be wary of _drastic action_.

# _Thinking Fast and Slow_, Daniel Kahneman

- _What you see is all there is_: Type 1 thinking never stops to ask, "What information am I missing?"

# _Meditations_, Marcus Aurelius

- And to see clearly, from his example, that a man can show both strength and flexibility. (I.8)
- "If you seek tranquillity, do less." Or (more accurately) do what's essential -- what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. (IV.24)
- You're better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve. (IV.32)
- Words once in common use now sound archaic. And the names of the famous dead as well.... Everything fades so quickly, turns into legend, and soon oblivion covers it. And those are the ones who shone. The rest -- "unknown, unasked-for" a minute after death. What is "eternal" fame? Emptiness. Then what should we work for? Only this: proper understanding, unselfish action, truthful speech. A resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing like water from that same source and spring. (IV.33)
- A little wisp of soul carrying a corpse. (IV.41)
- "It's unfortunate that this has happened." No. It's fortunate that this has happened and I've remained unharmed by it -- not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it.
- The things you think about determine the quality of your mind. Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts. (V.16)
- Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone -- those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the "what" is in constant flux, the "why" has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what's right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us -- a chasm whose depths we cannot see. (V.23)
- Remember: Matter. How tiny your share of it. Time. How brief and fleeting your allotment of it. Fate. How small a role you play in it. (V.24)
- Soon you'll be ashes, or bones. A mere name, at most -- and even that is just a sound, an echo. The things we want in life are empty, stale, and trivial. (V.33)
- Pride is a master of deception: when you think you're occupied in the weightiest business, that's when he has you in his spell. (VI.13)
- Alexander the Great and his mule driver both died and the same thing happened to both. They were absorbed alike into the life force of the world, or dissolved alike into atoms. (VI.24)
- Our lives are short. The only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts. (VI.30)
- Does the sun try to do the rain's work? (VI.43)
- It doesn't bother you that you weigh only x or y pounds and not three hundred. Why should it bother you that you have only x or y years to live and not more? You accept the limits placed on your body. Accept those placed on your time. (VI.49)
- Our own worth is measured by what we devote our energy to. (VII.3)
- No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. Like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, "No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished." (VII.15)
- Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly. (VII.56)
- And this too: you don't need much to live happily. And just because you've abandoned your hopes of becoming a great thinker or scientist, don't give up on attaining freedom, achieving humility, serving others, obeying God. (VII.67)
- It's silly to try to escape other people's faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own. (VII.71)
- What dies doesn't vanish. It stays here in the world, transformed, dissolved, as parts of the world, and of you. Which are transformed in turn -- without grumbling. (VIII.18)
- And the whole earth a mere point in space. (VIII.21)
- You have to assemble your life yourself -- action by action. (VIII.32)

# _Man's Search for Meaning_, Viktor E. Frankl

- Dostoevski said once, "There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings."
- If there is meaning in life at all, then there must be meaning in suffering.
- It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future.
- Nietzsche's words: "He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how."
- We had to learn for ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that _it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us_.
- What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.
- If architects want to strengthen a decrepit arch, they _increase_ the load which is laid upon it, for thereby the parts are joined more firmly together.
- The existential vacuum: "No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do."
- What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment. To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: "Tell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?"
- Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated.
- In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by _answering for_ his own life; to life he can only respond by becoming responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.
- Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now.
- I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system. I have termed this constitutive characteristic "the self-transcendence of human existence." It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself -- be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself -- by giving himself to a cause or to serve another person person to lve -- the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.
- Thus far we have shown that the meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be.
- When we are no longer able to change a situation -- just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer -- we are challenged to change ourselves.
- To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.
- On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from a calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its prececessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest.
- Every age has its own collective neurosis.
- Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.
- Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the _Shema Yisrael_ on his lips.
- For the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best.
- _Hyper-intention_: Set out to explicitly cause what you fear will happen.

# The Expanse, James S.A. Corey

- In _Leviathan Wakes_, Holden & crew discover the protomolecule, which takes over the station on _Eros_. The novel ends when Detective _Miller_ crashes the station into Venus.
- In _Caliban's War_, the protomolecule is used to create supersoldiers.
- In _Abaddon's Gate_, the protomolecule launches a ring from Venus. There is a battle to control the space between the rings.
- In _Cibola Burn_, humans try to colonize the first planet beyond the rings. The climax involves the first contact with the mysterious thing that destroyed the ancient alien civilization. Because the colonization (kinda) works, the book ends ominously: "Mars is fucked." Who wants to stay and terraform when you can move to a habitable planet?
- In _Nemesis Games_, the OPA morphs into _the Free Navy_ which unleashes catastrophe on the Earth by "dropping rocks."
- In _Babylon's Ashes_, the Free Navy is finally defeated by the ship-eating mysteries of the rings. The OPA gets re-invented as a shipping guild to manage the gates.
